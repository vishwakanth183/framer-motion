I’m a Software Developer passionate about creating scalable, user-focused applications that solve real-world problems.\n
With experience across front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building clean, performant solutions for both web and mobile using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Node.js, SQL/NoSQL databases, and AWS.\n
I enjoy working across the stack—whether it’s crafting intuitive UI experiences, designing reliable APIs, or setting up CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitHub Actions.\n
I’ve also explored microservices, cloud deployments, caching, and system resiliency, giving me the versatility to handle end-to-end development challenges.\n
Beyond coding, I value team collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning.\n
I believe software isn’t just about writing code—it’s about delivering value, improving performance, and shaping meaningful digital experiences.\n
Currently, I’m expanding my skills in AI-driven solutions and cloud-native architectures, aiming to build smarter, more scalable applications for the future.\n
If you’re looking for a developer who can blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving, let’s connect.\n
